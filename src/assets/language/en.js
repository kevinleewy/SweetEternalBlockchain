   INSTRUCTIONS_section2Header: 'Why Blockchain?',
   INSTRUCTIONS_section2Question1: 'What is blockchain?',
   INSTRUCTIONS_section2Answer1: 'By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Thus once deployed, the contract cannot be tempered by any centralized institution. It is very fair and to the truth.',
   INSTRUCTIONS_section2Question2: 'Why use blockchain?',
   INSTRUCTIONS_section2Answer2: 'Your identity of being the Guradian will always be recorded on the blockchain, effective for the eternity. At the same time, the price is defined by the audience. It is the true decentralized ranking.',
